====================================

Welcome to the Perl Application Framework
=========================================
This represents a collection of useful libraries & utilities 
I have developed over the years.
The purpose is to speed up my own perl application development by providing
a standarised way of generating command line apps that keeps me happy. 

Features include:

   - Command line parsing
   - Configuration file handling (XML and INI parsers)
   - Plugin Factory
   - Directory Iteratiors
   - Remote host Execution
   - Rudimetry Object Store
   - Download Cache

I'm sure a lot of this stuff could be superceeded by supported CPAN modules,
but they probably didn't exist, they were to immature, or I was simply 
not aware of them.

There are unit tests galore (and even a rudimentry unit test framework), but
but I'm pretty sure code coverage is far from complete.

Feel free to use as you need. GPL v2.0 licence applies.

CPAN modules Required
=====================
CPAN is perls package manager. 
You will need to install the modules defined in the cpan_dependencies file.
There are many ways to do this, e.g. system pacakges, or you can use cpan itself.

e.g. from the comamnd line:
sudo cpan < cpan_dependencies
