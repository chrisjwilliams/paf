The Perl Application Framework
Copyright Chris Williams 1996-2014 (unless otherwise specified in the preamble of each file)


Welcome to the Perl Application Framework
=========================================
This represents a collection of useful libraries & utilities I have developed over the years.
The purpose is to speed up my own perl application development by providing a standarised way
of generating apps that keeps me happy. 

I'm sure a lot of this stuff could be superceeded by supported CPAN modules, but they probably didn't
exist, they were to immature or I was simply not aware of then when I was writing this stuff and so I
developed my own solution.  There are unit tests galore (and even a rudimentry unit test framework), but
but I'm pretty sure code coverage is far from complete.

Feel free to use as you need. GPL v2.0 licence applies.

CPAN modules Required
=====================
CPAN is perls package manager. You will need to install the following modules to use PAF:

File::Sync
File::Path
File::Spec
LWP::UserAgent
Mozilla::CA

e.g. 

cpan install Mozilla::CA
